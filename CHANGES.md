Changes
===========================
This is a list of changes made from assignment 2 to assigment 3

* Adjusted grid width and height in the GameGrid class
* Changed initial ship energy level from 100 to 115 in the Ship class
* Changed the rest enery change from 10% to 9%
* Increased mine energy damage from 30% to 35%
* Added a restart game button to the dashboard
** Integrated the functionality to reset the game when this button is clicked
* Increased the amount of energy required to make a move from 100x the distance to 105x
* Moves no longer consume energy
* Added L-mines
** L-mines are created when a K-Mine lands on another K-Mine
* Modified the dashboard notices to incorporate the numerical constants instead of having hard coded values
* Setup a "cyclone" animation
* Made this animation run when the user wins the game
* Adjusted game to generate a mine when the user stays in the current location

My game had a decent design, so it was fairly simple to adjust the constants
and extend the game to incorporate the new features.
